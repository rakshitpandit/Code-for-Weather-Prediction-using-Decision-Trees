Weather-Prediction-using-Decision-Trees

This code provides a simple weather prediction model using decision trees. It retrieves weather data from an API, trains a decision tree model using the data, and allows the user to either look up the weather on a specific day or predict the weather on a specific day. The user interface is a simple menu that allows the user to choose between the two options. The code uses pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for machine learning, and joblib for saving the trained model.
